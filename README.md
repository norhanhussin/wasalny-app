**Wasalny** is an innovative Egyptian social shipping platform designed to bridge the gap between travelers and people needing to ship items. By connecting people heading in the same direction, it reduces travel costs for drivers and provides a faster, cheaper shipping alternative for senders.

## 🚀 Core Features

* **Dual-User Journey**: Tailored interfaces for both "Travelers" (to add trips) and "Senders" (to browse and book shipping).
* **Trip Management System**: A streamlined process for users to list their travel details including destination, timing, and available space.
* **Direct WhatsApp Integration**: Facilitates instant communication and negotiation between parties via a single click.
* **Dynamic Landing Page**: Features an engaging UI that explains the service steps (Search, Contact, Deliver) clearly to new users.
* **Live Performance Counters**: Displays real-time statistics of available trips and saved kilometers to encourage community participation.
* **Mobile-Optimized Design**: A fully responsive layout ensuring travelers can access and update trips on the go.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flexbox & Grid systems).
* **Scripting**: Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic navigation and logic handling.
* **Responsive Framework**: Custom CSS media queries combined with Bootstrap 5 components.
* **Animations**: Smooth scrolling and entrance effects for a professional feel.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `index.html`: The main landing page and service overview.
* `add-trip.html`: Form for travelers to submit new journey details.
* `browse-trips.html`: Marketplace for senders to find matching travel routes.
* `login.html`: Secure entry point for the user community.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  **Search or Post**: Users can either search for an existing trip or post their own travel plan.
2.  **Instant Connection**: Senders contact travelers directly via WhatsApp to agree on terms.
3.  **Secure Delivery**: Items are delivered through a trusted community-based network.
